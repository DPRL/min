Things to work on:

1. Load image menu not working currently.
2. Symbols from images are hard to see in edit mode (should behave like typed symbols).
3. Slider expression drag no longer working.

4. Still 'flickering' when parsing uploaded images or Undo-ing a grouping.
   Perhaps we need to queue all symbols first, then call rendering functions
   in this case?
