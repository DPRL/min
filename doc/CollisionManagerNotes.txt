1) It appears that we will need some sort of collision management in order to
find out if something is in the rectangle we draw in RectSelectMode. However,
nothing else in the system should need this functionality so it can be taken
from CollisionManager and moved into RectSelectMode. 

2) Then we can eliminate some global state by having RectSelect mode record
start mouse position (on mouse down) then on mouse up you just iterate through
all on-screen segments/groups and see if it is in the rectangle. 

3) Stroke selection doesn't need collision manager. Instead we can keep a list
of selected segments, the segments can add themselves to a list through an
onMouseOver event when the user is drawing a stroke.

4) Editor.DrawMode.js has only two references to the Collision manager. It might
be a good place to start so you can see what a better use of event handlers
might look like.
