README (CROHME InkML viewer)
R. Zanibbi, April 2013.

This program was originally created by Richard Pospesel in 2011, and modified by Kevin Hart. For CROHME 2013, I have made a number of small changes to the way in which attributes are displayed.

SYMBOL MAPPINGS

  Symbol mappings are defined using a dictionary in the file code.js.
  If a symbol does not render properly, try adding the appropriate
  unicode symbol (the \u codes found in the file).
