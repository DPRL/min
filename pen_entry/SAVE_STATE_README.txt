There are two methods of editor for saving and restoring the state of the canvas that are not wired to any UI actions.  They are Editor.save_state() and Editor.restore_state(), respectively.  The former returns a json string that encodes the state, and the latter takes such a string as the only paramter.  These functions are in Editor.js.

Subclasses of Segment (that is, PenStroke and SymbolSegment) have methods of the same name that get called by the Editor methods.  If you run the functions (ie run Editor.save_state() from the console and Editor.restore_state() with that output, you'll see that it mostly works but the bounding box gets messed up.  Enjoy.
